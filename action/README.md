| :--- | :--- |

This repository is the canonical Marketplace-facing wrapper for the scanner action. The hol-guard repository remains the source of truth, while this published action bundle keeps the required root `action.yml` layout for GitHub Marketplace.

The legacy action slug `hashgraph-online/hol-codex-plugin-scanner-action@v1` remains supported as a compatibility alias for existing workflows. New integrations should use `hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1`.

The default Marketplace install path uses an exact `plugin-scanner` PyPI release, verifies its PyPI provenance against `hashgraph-online/hol-guard`, and only then installs it. After installation, the default `scan`, `lint`, and offline `verify` paths operate on local repository content only. Live network probing and submission automation remain explicit opt-in features.

Advanced distribution paths are available when you need them:

- `install_source: local` is the explicit dogfood path for `uses: ./action` inside the source repo.
- `ghcr.io/hashgraph-online/hol-guard` is the container distribution for enterprise runners that prefer a reviewed OCI image over runtime package installation.

| `pr_comment_id` | PR comment ID when available |
| `pr_comment_url` | PR comment URL when available |

The action also writes a concise summary to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` by default. The full report is written to the job log for `text` output, or to the file you pass through `output` for `json`, `markdown`, or `sarif`.

Mode notes:

- `scan` and `lint` respect `profile`, `config`, and `baseline`.
- `verify` respects `online` and writes a human-readable report for `format: text`.
- `submit` writes the plugin-quality artifact to `output` when provided, otherwise `plugin-quality.json`. `registry_payload_output` remains dedicated to the separate HOL registry payload.
- `online`, `submission_enabled`, and `upload_sarif` are the only common paths that intentionally reach beyond the runner after the scanner package itself has been installed.
- `pr_comment_status` currently defaults to `skipped` in this Marketplace wrapper path.

## Examples

### Basic scan with minimum score gate

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    min_score: 70
```

### SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
        with:
          plugin_dir: "."
          mode: scan
          format: sarif
          fail_on_severity: high
          upload_sarif: true
```

This `plugin_dir: "."` pattern is correct for both single-plugin repositories and multi-plugin marketplace repositories. When `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` exists, the action switches into repository mode and scans each local plugin entry declared under `./plugins/...`.

### With Cisco skill scanning

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    cisco_skill_scan: on
    cisco_policy: strict
    install_cisco: true
```

### Dogfood the source-repo action bundle

Use this only inside `hashgraph-online/hol-guard`, where the action can install the adjacent source tree directly.

```yaml
- uses: ./action
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    install_source: local
```

### Export registry payload for ecosystem automation

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
  id: scan
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    format: sarif
    upload_sarif: true
    registry_payload_output: ai-plugin-registry-payload.json

- name: Show trust signals
  run: |
    echo "Score: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.score }}"
    echo "Grade: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.grade_label }}"
    echo "Max severity: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.max_severity }}"
```

The registry payload mirrors the submission metadata used by HOL ecosystem automation, so the same scan can feed trust scoring, registry ingestion, badges, or awesome-list processing without reparsing the terminal output.

### Score 80+ and auto-file an awesome-list submission issue

When the scan reaches `80+` and does not trip the configured severity gate, the action opens or reuses a submission issue in `hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins`. The issue body includes a machine-readable registry payload so downstream registry automation can ingest the same submission event.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Scan plugin and submit if eligible
        id: scan
        uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
        with:
          plugin_dir: "."
          min_score: 80
          fail_on_severity: high
          submission_enabled: true
          submission_score_threshold: 80
          submission_token: ${{ secrets.AWESOME_CODEX_PLUGINS_TOKEN }}

      - name: Show submission issue
        if: steps.scan.outputs.submission_performed == 'true'
        run: echo "${{ steps.scan.outputs.submission_issue_urls }}"
```

Use a fine-grained token with `issues:write` on `hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins`. `submission_token` is required when `submission_enabled: true`. The action deduplicates by an exact hidden plugin URL marker in the issue body, so repeated pushes reuse the open submission issue instead of opening duplicates.

### Markdown report as PR comment

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
  id: scan
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    format: markdown
    output: scan-report.md

- name: Comment PR
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      const fs = require('fs');
      const report = fs.readFileSync('scan-report.md', 'utf8');
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body: report
      });
```

## Release Management

- Publish immutable releases for this Marketplace wrapper repository automatically from the source scanner repo when `action/` changes merge to `main`.
- Move the floating major tag `v1` to the latest compatible release.
- Keep the canonical action in its own public repository for GitHub Marketplace publication.
- Configure `ACTION_REPO_TOKEN` as a secret in the source repository so `publish-action-repo.yml` can automatically sync the canonical action repository, refresh the `awesome-codex-plugins` submission guide, create releases, and publish autogenerated release notes.
- Configure `AWESOME_CODEX_PLUGINS_TOKEN` as a secret with `contents:write` access to `hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins` so the same publish workflow can update the submission guide after each reviewed scanner release.
- Sync the install metadata and hash-locked runtime requirement files with the action bundle so the published action and the `awesome-codex-plugins` submission guide both point at the same reviewed scanner release and dependency closure.

## Source of Truth

The source bundle for this action lives in the main scanner repository under `action/`. Release artifacts from that repository should export a root-ready action bundle for the dedicated action repositories, and the publish workflow should refresh the `awesome-codex-plugins` submission guide from the same release metadata.

Direct edits in published action repositories should stay limited to Marketplace-specific copy or metadata. Functional changes and release publication logic belong in `hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner` so merges there can publish matching action releases automatically.

## Mode-based workflow

Set `mode` to one of `scan`, `lint`, `verify`, or `submit`.

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
  with:
    mode: verify
    plugin_dir: "."
```

For `submit` mode, point `plugin_dir` at one concrete plugin directory. Repository-mode discovery is supported for `scan`, `lint`, and `verify`, but `submit` intentionally remains single-plugin.

For `scan` mode, set `upload_sarif: true` to emit and upload SARIF automatically instead of wiring a separate upload step by hand.

## Container Distribution

The scanner is also published as an OCI image for container-first environments:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/hashgraph-online/hol-guard:<version> \
  scan /workspace --format text
```

The image installs the scanner from the reviewed source tree at release build time. It is separate from the Marketplace action so teams that prefer `docker://` or explicit `docker run` flows can use a pinned image without changing the secure default action path.
